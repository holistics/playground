#### Introduction 
Holistics Playground is a public demo environment where you can explore a variety of examples and freely experiment without affecting your workspace or other users.

The Holistics Playground can be used for several purposes:

- Explore the **Dashboard and Custom Chart Gallery**, where you can view sample dashboards and custom charts with their code, and clone them for your projects

- If you're looking to learn AQL, our **AQL tutorial** is available to help you get started, progressing from easy concepts to more advanced use cases.

- Our interactive playground allows you to navigate from any example in our documentation and try it out yourself.

#### Limitations
- This playground is a simplified version that focuses on development experience. For the complete BI workflow, try our [Full Demo](http://r.holistics.io/public-demo).
- Note: "Generate dashboards with AI" is a paid feature.
